# cams-act6

Jupyter notebook practicals developed for the 6th joint ECMWF CAMS, EUMETSAT and ESA training in atmospheric composition, held on 16-20 September 2024 at NILU in Kjeller, Norway.

Each directory in this repository contains code, Jupyter notebooks and other (non-data) files related to the practical sessions.

The directories are numbered according to the order in which they appear in [the course programme](https://atmosphere.copernicus.eu/6th-ecmwf-cams-esa-eumetsat-training-atmospheric-composition)
